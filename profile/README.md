# Annotation Garden Initiative

**Open infrastructure for collaborative annotation of neuroscience stimuli**

---

## Vision

Transform isolated annotation efforts into cumulative scientific knowledge. Every lab annotating the same stimulus should be contributing to a shared resource that grows richer over time.

## Mission

Build open infrastructure that enables researchers to share, refine, and build upon stimulus annotations through GitHub-based collaboration, BIDS/HED standards compliance, and modern visualization tools.

---

## The Problem We Solve

Labs repeatedly annotate the same naturalistic stimuli in isolation:
- The same movies, images, and audio get re-annotated for each study
- Annotations remain siloed in supplementary materials or lab servers
- Inconsistencies between annotation efforts confound meta-analyses
- Years of annotation work are lost when researchers move on

**The Annotation Garden Initiative transforms this fragmentation into collaborative growth.**

## Key Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Branches as Layers** | Different annotation perspectives (scenes, emotions, objects) live as Git branches that stack and merge |
| **Standards-Based** | Built on BIDS and HED specifications for machine-readable, interoperable annotations |
| **AI-Accelerated** | VLMs provide initial drafts; humans refine and validate |
| **Cross-Modal** | Compare annotations across modalities, populations, tasks, and environments |

---

## Flagship Datasets

| Dataset | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **[NSD](https://naturalscenesdataset.org)** | Active | 73,000 COCO images from 7T fMRI study |
| **[Forrest Gump](https://studyforrest.org)** | Coming | 2-hour movie with rich temporal annotations |
| **[HBN Movies](https://eeg2025.github.io)** | Planned | Child Mind Institute developmental EEG collection |
